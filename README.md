My Creative Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio is a collection of my journey as a researcher, writer, and designer.
It brings together my passion for ideas, stories, and creativity, all in one place.

About This Portfolio

This website is a living notebook of my work.
Here you’ll find:

Research → Papers, case studies, and deep dives into topics that inspire curiosity.

Writing → Articles, essays, and projects that show my love for words and storytelling.

Design → Creative work where ideas meet visuals — from web layouts to graphics.

I’ve built this space to connect, share, and keep adding as I grow.

The Look & Feel

I designed this portfolio to be:

Light & vibrant → A reflection of creativity and openness.

Illustration-driven → Because stories aren’t only told with words.

Simple & human → Easy to explore, with personality in every section.

✨ This space is not just about past projects — it’s about ideas in progress, words waiting to be written, and designs that are yet to be shaped.
